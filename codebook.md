## Variable Definitions: ##
- All original signal units are signals from the acceleraomter of the phone or the gyroscop.  These digital values (sampled at 50HZ) where them processed in various ways.

## Data Description: ##

The data was downloaded from http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  
The original webpage of the data may be found at: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones	Based upon information from the site, the data was from a Samsung Galaxy S II.  The sensors that data was collected from includes a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope.  The data is from a group of 30 volunteers within an age range of 19-48 performing several activities while wearing the Samsung Galaxy S II.  More details may be found by reviewing the file *features_info.txt* file.

## Data Transformations: ##
The data was transformed in the following general sequence:
- The data is downloaded and extracted.
- The test and train data are aggregated together.
- The initial column names are added to the data in memory.
- Mean and Standard Deviation values are extracted and the others columns are discarded.
- The column names are modified as follows:

 String Removed:  | String Added:
 ------------- | ------------- 
 "BodyBody"	|	"Body" because of error in the original data files.
 "-mean()"    | "MeanOf" added to the beginning    
 "meanFreq()"    | "MeanFrequencyOf" added to the beginning
 "-std()"	|	"StandardDeviationOf" added to the beginning
"tBodyAcc" | "BodyLinearAcceleration"
"fBodyAcc" | "FrequencyOfBodyLinearAcceleration"
"tGravityAcc" | "GravityLinearAcceleration"
"tBodyGyroAcc" | "BodyRotationalAcceleration"
"tBodyGyro" | "BodyRotationalVelocity"
"fBodyGyro" | "FrequencyOfBodyRotationalVelocity"
"Mag" | "Magnitude"
"Jerk" | "Derivative"

- A second set of data of all of the averages for all of the variables for each Subject and Activity combination was generated.
- Column names "SubjectIDSummaryIndex" and "ActivityNameSummaryIndex" are added to identify the pairs.
- The word "Average" is added to the front of each variable (i.e., column name) as found in the code book for the second set of data.
- The second set of data is extracted as a *results.txt* file.
